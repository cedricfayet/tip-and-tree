# ![WooCommerce](http://woocommerce.com) Tip & Tree

Project build during Enssat Hackathon.

WooCommerce tip & Tree is an addon for WooCommerce that adds an optional fee on the checkout page that compensates the carbon impact used for orders shipping. This fee is directly sent to a charity for reforestation. The shop owner never gets this fee in his bank account. The algorithm defines the number of trees to plant based on order total amount, order weight and distance between shipping destination and shop location.
